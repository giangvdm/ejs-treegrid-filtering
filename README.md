# PHP x EJS Treegrid Filtering

## Introduction

This is a test that I was asked to complete by a client (probably).
The test requires the filtering feature in the treegrid to work properly.
Also, an extra requirement from the client is when the user inputs values as an array, separated by semicolons ";", it should filter the column by those values.
The "project" consists of pure PHP and [EJS Treegrid](http://www.treegrid.com/).

## Instructions

### Setup your host

- Setup your host and database
- Put all code in the root directory of the project/website

### Setup your database
